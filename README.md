# RNN and TextMining
## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

### Text analysis
1. "I am a Cat" by Soseki Natsume
2. "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" by Luo Guanzhong
* Implement text analysis using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).Train a model to predict the next character in a given character sequence, and generate longer text sequences by repeatedly calling the model. Although some sentences may conform to grammatical rules, most of them do not have actual meaning. This will be a key point * for future breakthroughs in my work.
* This model is character-based. At the beginning of training, the model does not know how to form a word, and does not even know that a word is a unit of text.
* This model is trained on small batches of text (100 characters per batch). Despite this, the model is still able to generate longer text sequences that are structurally coherent.
